## Proposal 1 - Lung Cancer Mortality Across the United States

 I would like to scrape the CDC Wonder website to compare mortality rates due to lung cancer across the regions of the United States. My hypothesis will be that each region (West, Midwest, etc) has equal death rates due to lung cancer. Time permitting, I would also like to compare across regions by age, race, and gender.

## Proposal 2 - Are Classic Books rated higher?

I love a good book. I would like to scrape the top books that everyone should read according to Goodreads. Are these books that Goodreads thinks I should read rated higher? My hypothesis would be that higher ranked books in the list are not rated higher on average than the lower ranked books. Additionally I would like to investigate these books based on their length and release date as well.
