## Proposal 1 - Simpsons Episode Quality Predictor

In my teenage years, I loved the television show The Simpsons. As I got older, I agree with most of the rest of the world that as the Simpsons aged, the show quality declined. However that doesn't diminish the quality of the show in its early years. Using a data set I found online, I would like to look at what made a higher quality Simpsons episode.

Some of the features include:

* IMDB rating, air date, title, number of viewers
* Spoken dialogue by each character in the episode
* Locations (settings) appearing in the episode

Aditionally, depending on what I learn with NLP, if it is possible I would also like to look at how the dialogue relates to th episode quality as well. Were certian lines, jokes, or topics associated with episode rating?

## Proposal 1 - Lung Cancer Mortality Across the United States

 I would like to scrape the CDC Wonder website to compare mortality rates due to lung cancer across the regions of the United States. My hypothesis will be that each region (West, Midwest, etc) has equal death rates due to lung cancer. Time permitting, I would also like to compare across regions by age, race, and gender.

## Proposal 2 - Are Classic Books rated higher?

I love a good book. I would like to scrape the top books that everyone should read according to Goodreads. Are these books that Goodreads thinks I should read rated higher? My hypothesis would be that higher ranked books in the list are not rated higher on average than the lower ranked books. Additionally I would like to investigate these books based on their length and release date as well.
