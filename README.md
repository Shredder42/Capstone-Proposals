## Proposal 1 - Lung Cancer Mortality Across the United States

 I would like to scrape the CDC Wonder website to compare mortality rates due to lung cancer across the regions of the United States. My hypothesis will be that each region (West, Midwest, etc) has equal death rates due to lung cancer. Time permitting, I would also like to compare across regions by age, race, and gender.

## Proposal 2 - Are Longer Movies better?

I love a good story. I have always wondered if people are more likely to rate movies higher if they were longer. Were the plot and characters more developed? Did I feel like I had to rate it high because I invested more time in a longer movie? I would like to scrape the top 1000 highest rated movies on the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) and perform a t-test to determine if the longer movies (threshold(s) to be determined by the data) are indeed rated higher than shorter movies. Times of movies would be normally distributed. If time permits, I would also like to examine rankings by genre and release year.
